x Don't save blank entities for every request
x Code smell: POST test is too long?
x Display multiple entities in the table.
- Clean up after ft runs.
- Support more than one set of entities.

- Adjust models so that entities are associated with different users.
- Add unique URLs for each user (list of entities.)
- Add a IRL for creating a new list (user) of entities via POST
- Add URLs for adding entities to existing lists (users') via POST

Combine 
1. Adding new functionality
    adding a new ft and new application code
2. Refactoring application code
    to deliver same functionality but using new design

If use relational data base:

Tables:
    users
    entities: user/entity, entity_name, full_name, 
For each user/entity, there'll be
    cofa: acnt_n(1'), title1, title2, d_or_c, summary_y_n
    je: AutoNumber, user, date, text
    li: AutoNumber, je, amt, acnt, d_or_c

If use file system for persistent storage as in the pre Django
version of the debk program (all text files) the functional tests
will have to have a setUp and tearDown part to deal with the data
base.  This was already implemented in the first attempt made when
I was reading the first edition of Percival's book.
